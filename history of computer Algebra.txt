tell all computer algebra from 1800 even from pascal bone to 2021 list all
ChatGPT
Listing every computer algebra system (CAS) and development in the field from 1800 to 2021 is a monumental task. Additionally, computer algebra as we know it today didn't exist until the mid-20th century. Here, I'll provide some key milestones and notable systems in the history of computer algebra, starting from the mid-20th century:

MIDAC (Mid-20th Century): The history of computer algebra begins with early machines like MIDAC (Midwestern Universities Research Association Digital Computer), which was one of the first computers used for mathematical computations.

MACSYMA (1960s): Developed at MIT, MACSYMA was one of the first computer algebra systems and is considered a pioneer in symbolic mathematics.

REDUCE (1960s): Developed at the RAND Corporation and later at the University of Utah, REDUCE was another early CAS that aimed to automate algebraic manipulation.

Schoonschip (1970s): A computer algebra system developed by an Amsterdam-based group, Schoonschip was notable for its work in algebraic manipulation and simplification.

Maple (1980s): Maple was developed in the 1980s and is known for its mathematical computation capabilities and symbolic manipulation.

Mathematica (1988): Developed by Wolfram Research, Mathematica is a widely used CAS for mathematical computation, symbolic manipulation, and visualization.

MuPAD (1990s): MuPAD is another commercial CAS known for its symbolic mathematics capabilities.

Maxima (late 1980s, open source): Derived from the original Macsyma, Maxima is an open-source CAS that provides symbolic mathematics and algebraic manipulation.

SymPy (2005, open source): A Python library for symbolic mathematics and computer algebra, SymPy has gained popularity in the open-source community.

SAGE (2005, open source): SAGE is an open-source mathematics software system that integrates various mathematics software components, including computer algebra.

GiNaC (2003, open source): GiNaC is a C++ library for symbolic mathematics and computer algebra.

Axiom (1980s, open source): Axiom is an open-source computer algebra system that includes various mathematical components.

Octave (open source): Although Octave is primarily a numerical computing environment like MATLAB, it incorporates some computer algebra functionality.

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the field of computer algebra has seen numerous developments, both in commercial and open-source systems, since its inception. Additionally, many more specialized and domain-specific computer algebra systems and libraries have been developed over the years. If you need more specific information about a particular system or aspect of computer algebra, please feel free to ask.

yacas and eigen math mathcad tell about them and symbolic computing in c++ julia and sympy in python and matrix and tensor calculus i python
ChatGPT
Sure, I can provide information on Yacas, Eigen, Mathcad, symbolic computing in C++ and Julia, SymPy in Python, and matrix and tensor calculus in Python:

Yacas:

Yacas stands for "Yet Another Computer Algebra System." It's an open-source computer algebra system primarily used for symbolic mathematical computation.
Yacas is written in C++ and has a Lisp-based language for its scripting and symbolic manipulation.
Eigen:

Eigen is not a computer algebra system; it's a C++ template library for linear algebra. It provides high-performance, specialized matrix and vector operations, making it a popular choice for numerical computations in C++.
Mathcad:

Mathcad is a commercial computer software system used for mathematical computation, documentation, and visualization.
It offers a unique "WYSIWYG" (What You See Is What You Get) interface that allows engineers and scientists to create and document mathematical computations and analyses.
Symbolic Computing in C++:

C++ is not commonly used for symbolic mathematics, but it is possible to perform symbolic calculations using libraries like GiNaC. However, C++ is more widely used for numerical and scientific computing.
Julia:

Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical and scientific computing. While it's not a symbolic computing system, Julia has packages like SymPy.jl that allow symbolic mathematics within the Julia environment.
SymPy in Python:

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It provides features for symbolic manipulation, algebra, calculus, equation solving, and more.
It is widely used for tasks that require symbolic computation in Python, making it a valuable tool for mathematicians, scientists, and engineers.
Matrix and Tensor Calculus in Python:

Python offers various libraries for matrix and tensor calculus, including NumPy for basic linear algebra operations.
For more advanced operations, libraries like SciPy and TensorFlow (for deep learning applications) can handle tensors efficiently.
SymPy, mentioned earlier, can also perform symbolic matrix and tensor calculus operations.
In summary, Yacas and SymPy are popular open-source symbolic mathematics systems, while Eigen is a high-performance C++ library for numerical linear algebra. Mathcad is a commercial software package for mathematical documentation. Symbolic computing in C++ is possible but not as common, and Julia can be used for numerical and symbolic mathematics. Python, with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and SymPy, is a versatile platform for matrix and tensor calculus.
